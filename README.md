Bookmark+ is a chrome extension to manage your bookmarks just as you do with your App on your smart phone desktop.

It's quite simple, no rocket science, not a big deal, I'm just fresh man:-)

Meaning
-------

When the Web App times comes, websites are actually apps, so bookmark+ can be a Internet Entrance, just like Go Desktop, Facebook Desktop, etc.That's what I'm thinking about.
